# decomp
Decompilation Scripts

Ground up decompilation for ARM Thumb. Gets you from ASM provided by GCC to roughly making sense C code.

Still has some bugs, but works well enough for me. See chalandpaste/decomp-vim for some handy helpers to hook into vim.

Use your own risk, documentation/comments are terrible and you'll need to intuit some weird graph algorithsm which I've haven't really cleaned up.
